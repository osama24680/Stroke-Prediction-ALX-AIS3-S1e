# ðŸ©º Stroke Prediction Notebook ðŸš€

Welcome to our notebook on the **Prediction of Strokes**! This project aims to analyze and predict the risk of stroke occurrences using machine learning, aiding in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare measures. Stroke, a serious medical condition, is among the leading causes of death globally, accounting for approximately 11% of total deaths worldwide according to the **World Health Organization (WHO)**.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Description

Stroke can have life-altering consequences. Early detection of potential stroke cases is critical for timely intervention and improved health outcomes. Using a dataset with various health and lifestyle parameters, we employ machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a stroke occurrence. Features analyzed include:
- **Patient Demographics:** Gender, age, smoking status
- **Health Conditions:** Diabetes, hypertension, heart conditions
- **Lifestyle Factors:** Physical activity, smoking status

Join us as we uncover insights from this data and contribute to stroke prevention and awareness efforts. ðŸ’ŠðŸ’¡
